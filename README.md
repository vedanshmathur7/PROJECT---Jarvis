**JARVIS: Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant**  

I developed a voice-activated virtual assistant, "Jarvis," designed to streamline daily tasks with advanced features like voice recognition, text-to-speech, web browsing, music playback, news fetching, and intelligent query handling using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. With seamless integration of libraries such as `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, and `gTTS`, Jarvis delivers a dynamic user experience, performing tasks like opening websites, playing music, fetching news, and responding to complex queriesâ€”all activated by the wake word "Jarvis." This project demonstrates my expertise in Python, API integration, and natural language processing, blending technology into an intuitive personal assistant.
